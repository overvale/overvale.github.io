<h1>Kill Buffer DWIM</h1>

<time>2021, Summer</time>

<p>
  When you call <code>kill-buffer</code> Emacs prompts you for which buffer you'd like to
  kill. The default choice is the current buffer, which is good because 9 times
  out of 10 that's the buffer I want to kill, but confirming that choice every
  time is tedious.
</p>

<p>
  Emacs has a wonderful convention of "do what I mean" (DWIM) commands, versions of
  commands which do one thing if a condition is met and another if it isn't. My
  version of <code>kill-buffer</code> should kill the current buffer by default, and if it is
  prefixed by the universal argument I should be prompted for which buffer I'd
  like to kill. The best of both worlds I think.
</p>

<pre><code>(defun kill-buffer-dwim (&amp;optional u-arg)
  "Call kill-current-buffer, with C-u: call kill-buffer."
  (interactive "P")
  (if u-arg
      (call-interactively 'kill-buffer)
    (call-interactively 'kill-current-buffer)))</code></pre>
