	<blockquote>“Our self-image is composed of historical evidence of our abilities. The more hard things you push yourself to do, the more competent you will see yourself to be. If you can run marathons or throw double your body weight over your head, the sleep deprivation from a newborn is only a mild irritant. If you can excel at organic chemistry or econometrics, onboarding for a new finance job will be a breeze.”</blockquote>

<p>“Our digital calendars turned out to be just marginally better than their pen and paper predecessors. And since their release, neither Outlook nor Google Calendar have really changed in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>Isn’t it ironic that, of all things, it’s our time machines that are stuck in the past?</p>
<p>The essay at hand is an exploration of what calendars could be if they weren’t stuck in time. But before we discuss their future, we first need to analyze their present status and how they fit into the rest of the productivity stack.”</p>

<li><p>From a <a href="https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2023/4/11/-reviewing-mastering-the-art-of-command">review of Mastering the Art of Command: Admiral Chester W. Nimitz and Victory in the Pacific</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“War is a human endeavor and technology alone does not win wars. Because people fight wars, finding the best ways to exploit their talents is central to attaining victory. Therefore, a commander’s greatest attribute is an ability to place the right people in the right jobs and his effect on morale. Leadership is an intangible, composed of personality and vision and its practice an art. Good leaders stress clarity of intent—state the goal but never tell people how to do things. This fosters a collaborative organizational culture that avoids blame by encouraging learning from mistakes to take bold but calculated risks. A good commander is accessible and promotes subordinates sharing their stories as a way to learn and communicate, creating an adaptable, innovative, and flexible organization based on mutual trust and confidence. Those in formal leadership positions must be cognizant of the welfare of those they lead: their well-being must be encouraged as this is one way a leader ensures organizational effectiveness. All leaders must also set aside time for self-reflection to remind themselves all success includes other people.”</p> </blockquote> </li>

<li><p>My favorite write-up on Apple's Vision Pro comes from <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Vision_Pro">Andy Matuschak</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>“This is not a someday-maybe tech demo of a future paradigm; it’s (mostly) today’s paradigm, transliterated to new display and input technology. Apple is not (yet) trying to lead the way by demonstrating visionary “killer apps” native to the spatial interface paradigm.”</p></blockquote>

<li><p>I've only read the first book in the <i>Years of Lyndon Johnson</i> series by Robert Caro, but <a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/lyndon-johnson">this write-up</a> matches my takeaways so far.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Scoop Jackson would say that when Jack Kennedy, as President, urgently needed a senator’s vote, he would summon him to the Oval Office and “would explain precisely why the bill was so important and how much he needed the senator’s support.” If, however, the senator said his constituency would not permit him to give that support, that if he gave Kennedy the vote he needed, the vote might cost him his seat in the Senate, “Kennedy would finally say he was sorry they couldn’t agree, but he understood.” Lyndon Johnson, Jackson would say—and Jackson worked closely with Johnson as Representative and Senator for twenty-five years—Lyndon Johnson wouldn’t understand, would refuse to understand. He would “charm you or knock your block off, or bribe you or threaten you, anything to get your vote,” Jackson would say. He would do anything he had to, to get that vote. “And he’d get it. That was the difference.”</p></blockquote>

<li><blockquote><p>“Artists must be allowed to go through bad periods! They <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2023/05/07/artists-must-be-allowed-to-make-bad-work/">must be allowed to do bad work!</a> They must be allowed to get in a mess! They must be allowed to have dud experiments! They must also be allowed to have periods where they repeat themselves in a rather aimless, fruitless way before they can pick up and go on. The kind of attention that they get now, the kind of atmosphere of excitement which attends today the creation of works of art, the way that everything is done too much in the public eye, it’s really too much. The pressures are of a kind which are anti-creative.”</p></blockquote></li>

<li><blockquote>“By 2100, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/27/megalopolis-how-coastal-west-africa-will-shape-the-coming-century">Lagos-Abidjan stretch</a> is projected to be the largest zone of continuous, dense habitation on earth, with something in the order of half a billion people.”</blockquote></li>

<li><blockquote><p>“The old <a href="https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/03/30/a-school-of-strength-and-character/">“school of strength and character”</a> is gone. The nineteenth-century pattern of life that created it no longer exists. But the features of its social fabric demonstrate what an agentic society with a recognizably modern set of technologies and institutions looks like. This culture was upstream of organizations like the Sanitary Commission, making possible the agentic behaviors of those who founded them. Three features are especially prominent: the aspirational ideal of public brotherhood, a commitment to formality and discipline in self-government, and organizational structures that combined decentralization with hierarchy. These are the same patterns any future culture of high agency self-government will also have to cultivate in themselves and their neighbors. ”</p></blockquote></li>


<li><p><a href="http://www.tobyord.com/writing/a-childs-plaything">A Child’s Plaything</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Imagine if we could somehow show the people of the eighteenth century a simple child’s toy from today — say, a speaking doll.</p> <p>The common folk would marvel at its ability to speak its few stock phrases. The scientists and engineers would marvel even more at its innards; at the minutely detailed silicon; at the bewildering complexity soon to be within their grasp.</p> <p>But the economists would be amazed. For this design — so far beyond the peak of their world’s powers — was not a gift for a King or Queen, but clearly just a child’s toy. And not just that. The very banality of the toy, the artlessness of the sculpting and the way the paint doesn’t even quite line up with the contours of the doll’s face, prove that this is not the toy of a prince — but of poor child. And they would understand that the people of our time are so wealthy, so powerful, that every one of them has access to machines with thousands of parts working in concert, and that it is less effort to build such a wondrous machine than to simply paint a doll’s eyebrows in their right places.”</p> </blockquote></li>

<blockquote>
	<p>“Here is how platforms die: first, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die.
	<p>This is enshittification: surpluses are first directed to users; then, once they're locked in, surpluses go to suppliers; then once they're locked in, the surplus is handed to shareholders and the platform becomes a useless pile of shit. From mobile app stores to Steam, from Facebook to Twitter, this is the enshittification lifecycle.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The reason pessimists sound smart is that it’s hard to prove them definitively wrong. Pessimists are a moving target. If they predict that a technology will fail, and it succeeds, then there is always another reason why it won’t work. It might have solved one problem, but it won’t solve all of them. Or it might work for most people, but it won’t work for everyone. 
	
<p>There are almost limitless opportunities to shift the goalposts. A pessimistic stance is a safe one. There is often little to lose.
	
<p>Optimism is risky. It exposes us to failure. In fact, repeated failure is a given. That’s why it looks dumb from the outside. If we try to launch a rocket into space, and it’s a non-starter, someone gets blamed. If we try 99 designs for a new high-yielding crop variety, or a vaccine against malaria, we might fail 99 times. 
	
<p>We might even spend our entire career without a single breakthrough. There’s a downside to optimism. But the potential upside is much, much bigger. The 100th attempt at a vaccine might be the winner. The optimism to keep going might save hundreds of millions of lives.”</p></blockquote></li>

What that “about” was, or is, is something that could be more or less easily grasped. It’s the aboutness which, for me, is a short-circuiting of the art experience.”</p></li>

<blockquote> <p>People don’t realize that every single advanced manufacturing company — whether they’re making rockets, satellites, jets, drones, or energy for climate change — outsources about 80% to 90% of their custom parts. This isn’t like automotive where you’re printing 1,000 widgets to go on a Ford. This is “Hey, we need five crazy complex-geometry parts that are going on a rocket.” It’s about $40 or $50 billion in spend that’s coming out of these space, defense, and other advanced manufacturers going into a domestic supply chain, but it’s being routed through 3,000 or so small, owner-operated high-precision machine shops. So, in aggregate, it’s a huge industry, but it’s incredibly fragmented. You’ve really got 98% of that base doing less than $10 million in revenue.</p> </blockquote></li>

Some adapt, of course, but many flounder, especially when hired at very senior levels with daunting short-term expectations.
<p>Changing the organizational culture wholesale is an extraordinarily hard undertaking for precisely the same reasons why changing oneself to fit into a new culture is hard. Changing the culture of an organization, in effect, requires every single member of the organization to subject themselves to the aforementioned process of un-learning their current cultural practices, and internalizing the newer cultural tenets to the extent of informing every small decision they might take or discussion they might partake in. This is much, much harder to do at scale.”</p></blockquote></li>

They’re doing everything right. The form is perfect. It looks exactly the way it looked before. But it doesn’t work. No airplanes land.

- increased salary<br/>
- increased non-salary financial benefits such as bonuses and stock options<br/>
- promotions<br/>
- the ability to pick and choose your own projects and teammates<br/>
- control over your working arrangements<br/>
- flexible time<br/>
- working from home<br/>
- increased desirability in the job market<br/>
- the sense of accomplishment and pride that comes from doing good work<br/>
- (hopefully) the respect and admiration of your peers</p>
<p>The purpose of the guide is to help developers quickly become highly valuable to their organization, and to therefore get promotions, raises, and quality of work benefits on an accelerated time line.”</p></blockquote></li>

Every day I have to explain what I do to people who are different from me — marketing people, technical writers, my boss, my investors, my customers — none of whom belong to my profession or share my technical background or knowledge. As a consequence, I'm constantly forced to describe what I know in terms that other people can at least begin to understand. My success in my job depends to a large degree on my success in so communicating. At the very least, in order to remain employed I have to convince somebody else that what I'm doing is worth having them pay for it. <p>Contrast this situation with that of academia. Professors of Literature or History or Cultural Studies in their professional life find themselves communicating principally with other professors of Literature or History or Cultural Studies. They also, of course, communicate with students, but students don't really count. Graduate students are studying to be professors themselves and so are already part of the in-crowd. Undergraduate students rarely get a chance to close the feedback loop, especially at the so called better schools.”</p></blockquote></li>

<blockquote> <p>If you work in an organization, you know what it’s like to have too much to do and not enough resources to do it. Digital tools for communication and collaboration are meant to make it all more manageable, but access to technology often can’t fix the root causes: poor work design and entrenched organizational behaviors. The costs of overload are well-documented […] despite the evidence, many leaders continue to believe that their organizations thrive when overloaded, often both creating pressure and rewarding those who deliver under duress.

In this significant article he holds up an incentive for scientists when the fighting has ceased. He urges that men of science should then turn to the massive task of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge. For years inventions have extended man's physical powers rather than the powers of his mind. Trip hammers that multiply the fists, microscopes that sharpen the eye, and engines of destruction and detection are new results, but not the end results, of modern science. Now, says Dr. Bush, instruments are at hand which, if properly developed, will give man access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages. The perfection of these pacific instruments should be the first objective of our scientists as they emerge from their war work. Like Emerson's famous address of 1837 on The American Scholar, this paper by Dr. Bush calls for a new relationship between thinking man and the sum of our knowledge. <p>“Consider a future device … in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.” <p>“The applications of science have built man a well-supplied house, and are teaching him to live healthily therein. They have enabled him to throw masses of people against one another with cruel weapons. They may yet allow him truly to encompass the great record and to grow in the wisdom of race experience. He may perish in conflict before he learns to wield that record for his true good. Yet, in the application of science to the needs and desires of man, it would seem to be a singularly unfortunate stage at which to terminate the process, or to lose hope as to the outcome.”</p></blockquote></li>

After following study participants for six months after making their decision, Levitt found that those who had opted for the choice that involved making a change (as opposed to sticking with the status quo) were more satisfied with their decision and generally happier. ‘A good rule of thumb in decision making is, whenever you cannot decide what you should do, choose the action that represents a change, rather than continuing the status quo.’”</p></blockquote></li>

<blockquote><p>“How can you possibly justify a $200,000+ college expense? How can you justify a $100,000+ college expense? <p>This is not necessary.
<p>The average tenure hopeful adjunct makes $40 an hour. If you were to employ her as a private tutor at the cost of $60 an hour, and had four hours with her a week, and did that for 14 weeks (that’s the length of an average college course folks) that is about $3,400. 
<p>Were you to employ three such professor-tutors, that would be about $10,200, or a bit over $20,000 a year. In four years you would have racked up $80,000 in costs. But this is still $30,000 less than the total for the ‘cost conscious’ universities. It is a quarter of what you would pay for Trinity.
<p>Remember: this $80,000 is for private tutoring, where individual attention would give you far and away a better and more thorough education than the 300-kids-in-a-lecture-hall style of classes that dominate undergraduate education today. <p>But it can get even cheaper. Let’s say you take the general principle of group classes from the university. Say you can find four other people to take all of these other classes with you. Just four. Well that equals out to $680 per class, or $16,000 a person for four years of classes. 
<p>To be fair, add in $1,000-$2,000 for textbooks and a subscription to JSTOR, for a total of about $17,000 to $18,000 for four years.”</p></blockquote></li>

Technical Debt is a metaphor, coined by Ward Cunningham, that frames how to think about dealing with this cruft, thinking of it like a financial debt. The extra effort that it takes to add new features is the interest paid on the debt. Imagine I have a confusing module structure in my code base. I need to add a new feature. If the module structure was clear, then it would take me four days to add the feature but with this cruft, it takes me six days. The two day difference is the interest on the debt.</p> </blockquote></li>

<blockquote> <p>Lost in the multitude, the individual can almost never perceive the influence he exercises. Never does his will impress itself upon the whole; nothing confirms in his eyes his own cooperation. The exercise of political rights, therefore, offers us but a part of the pleasures that the ancients found in it, while at the same time the progress of civilization, the commercial tendency of the age, the communication amongst peoples, have infinitely multiplied and varied the means of personal happiness. It follows that we must be far more attached than the ancients to our individual independence. For the ancients when they sacrificed that independence to their political rights, sacrificed less to obtain more; while in making the same sacrifice! we would give more to obtain less. The aim of the ancients was the sharing of social power among the citizens of the same fatherland: this is what they called liberty. The aim of the moderns is the enjoyment of security in private pleasures; and they call liberty the guarantees accorded by institutions to these pleasures.</p> </blockquote></li>

When you’re thinking about giving work to someone slow, you run through the likely quagmire in your head; you visualize days of halting progress. You imagine a resource—this slow person—tied up for awhile. It’s wearisome, even in the thinking. Whereas the fast teammate—well, their time feels cheap, in the sense that you can give them something and know they’ll be available again soon. You aren’t “using them up” by giving them work. So you route as much as you can through the fast people. It’s ironic: your company’s most valuable resources—because they finish things quickly—are the easiest to consume. The general rule seems to be: systems which eat items quickly are fed more items. Slow systems starve.</p> </blockquote></li>

Comparatively, it feels indestructible. <p>On my hike I was able to do clunky in-field photo imports as a backup, but I wasn’t able to backup my audio recordings. That was irksome. But I was able to type out notes in a small hut up on the top of a mountain as I interviewed a Buddhist sculptor, having carried an extremely light machine up 2,000 meters of vertical ascent, through sleet and rain, and never once did I worry about the device letting me down. <p>Still, when I came home and opened my MacBook Pro, it sang. macOS is clunky in its own ways — with nearly fifty years of UI ideas piled atop each other, the incumbency of older technologies making it more complex than it should be. But, damn, it sings. It responds as quickly as I can type, and if I need to hack together a solution — figure out how to open a weird file or automate a process or drag data from one space to another — my iOS mittens are off and the precision is surgical.

For example:</p> <p>-  Set up deadlines and quotas for the eggs.<br/> -  Make the geese into managers.<br/> -  Make the geese go to meetings to justify their diet and day to day processes.<br/> -  Demand golden coins from the geese rather than eggs.<br/> -  Demand platinum rather than gold.<br/> -  Require that the geese make plans and explain just how they will make the eggs that will be laid.”</p></blockquote></li>

<blockquote> <p>One of the sneakier pitfalls of an efficiency-based attitude to time is that we start to feel pressured to use our leisure time “productively”, too – an attitude which implies that enjoying leisure for its own sake, which you might have assumed was the whole point of leisure, is somehow not quite enough.</p> </blockquote></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/everything-is-fiction">Everything is Fiction</a>:</p>

<blockquote> <p>I’ve written six books now, but instead of making it easier, it has complicated matters to the point of absurdity. I have no idea what I’m doing. All the decisions I appear to have made—about plots and characters and where to start and when to stop—are not decisions at all. They are compromises. A book is whittled down from hope, and when I start to cut my fingers I push it away from me to see what others make of it. And I wait in terror for the judgements of those others—judgements that seem, whether positive or negative, unjust, because they are about something that I didn’t really do. They are about something that happened to me. It’s a little like crawling from a car crash to be greeted by a panel of strangers holding up score cards.</p> </blockquote></li>

<li><p><a href="https://medium.com/graphicfacilitation/all-you-need-to-know-about-whiteboard-markers-2a25d1249911">All you need to know about whiteboard markers</a></p> <blockquote><p>“Maybe hundreds of thousands of people are using whiteboards everyday to communicate, create and innovate. It has been too long that whiteboard markers stayed overlooked and the time has come to shed some light on these humble pawns of strategic office play. <p>This is probably the most comprehensive review of one of the most underestimated tools of the modern technology world. While these markers are very important for the modern office life there is still a certain vacuum of information around the topic. <p>With this article I will try to break through the void of knowledge and share my review of the most popular markers found all over the world.”</p></blockquote></li>

<li><p><a href="https://research.swtch.com/acme">A Tour of Acme</a></p> <blockquote><p>“People I work with recognize my computer easily: it's the one with nothing but yellow windows and blue bars on the screen. That's the text editor acme, written by Rob Pike for Plan 9 in the early 1990s. Acme focuses entirely on the idea of text as user interface. It's difficult to explain acme without seeing it, though, so I've put together a screencast explaining the basics of acme and showing a brief programming session. Remember as you watch the video that the 854x480 screen is quite cramped. Usually you'd run acme on a larger screen: even my MacBook Air has almost four times as much screen real estate.”</p></blockquote></li>

<li><p><a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/trickle-down-workaholism-in-startups/">Trickle-Down Workaholism</a>:</p> 

<blockquote> <p>Neither [Kobe Bryant or Charles Darwin] were giving up anything on whatever contemporaries that may have put in more time, more hours, or greater sacrifices. Their contributions to the world were in no way diminished by their balanced approach, quite the contrary. So don’t tell me that there’s something uniquely demanding about building yet another fucking startup that dwarfs the accomplishments of The Origin of Species or winning five championship rings. It’s bullshit. Extractive, counterproductive bullshit peddled by people who either need a narrative to explain their personal sacrifices and regrets or who are in a position to treat the lives and wellbeing of others like cannon fodder.</p> </blockquote></li>
