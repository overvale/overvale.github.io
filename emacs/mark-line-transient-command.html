<h1>Mark Line &amp; Marking Transient Command</h1>

<p class="date">2021, Summer</p>

<p>
  Emacs has a lot of commands for marking (selecting) things.
  You can find them all by typing <code>M-x mark-</code> and seeing the available options.
  You can also read about (most of) them in the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Marking-Objects.html">manual</a>.
  They all work the same way, they leave the point where it is and extend the region (selection)
  forward by a given about (word, sentence, etc) by moving the "mark" (end of region).
</p>

<p>
  One command that is missing (no idea why) is one for marking lines.
  Fortunately, the code for <code>mark-end-of-sentence</code> is really simple and easily adapted to mark lines.
</p>

<code class="block">(defun mark-line (arg)
  "Put mark at end of line.
ARG works as in `forward-line'.  If this command is repeated,
it marks the next ARG lines after the ones already marked."
  (interactive "p")
  (push-mark
   (save-excursion
     (if (and (eq last-command this-command) (mark t))
     (goto-char (mark)))
     (forward-line arg)
     (point))
   nil t))
</code>

<p>
  Additionally I have <code>mark-end-of-sentence</code> aliased to <code>mark-sentence</code>
  to be more consistent with the other mark commands.
</p>

<p>
  I have also found it valuable to create a far more logical set of bindings for all these commands.
  I use the transient package for this, but you could set this up with a prefix binding or using another
  method you prefer.
</p>

<code class="block">(transient-define-prefix general-transient--mark ()
  "Transient for setting the mark."
  :transient-suffix 'transient--do-stay
  :transient-non-suffix 'transient--do-exit
  ["Mark"
   [("w" "Word" mark-word)
    ("s" "Sexp" mark-sexp)
    ("d" "Defun" mark-defun)]
   [("n" "Line" mark-line)
    (")" "Sentence" mark-sentence)
    ("}" "Paragraph" mark-paragraph)]
   [("&lt;" "Beginning of Buffer" mark-beginning-of-buffer)
    ("&gt;" "End of Buffer" mark-end-of-buffer)]
   [("x" "Exchange Point/Mark" exchange-point-and-mark :transient nil)
    ("q" "Quit" transient-quit-all)]])
</code>
