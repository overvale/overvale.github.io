<h1>Hello!</h1>

<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
  Hi! ðŸ‘‹
  <b>I'm Oliver Taylor</b>, welcome to my corner of the internet.
  I have no idea how you got here but I'm glad you made it.

<h2><a href="/notes/structured-to-innovate.html">Structured to Innovate</a></h2>

<p>An attempt to summarize the common ethos and project management approach of
  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
  (<small>DARPA</small>), Lockheed Martinâ€™s Skunk Works, and
  AT&amp;Tâ€™s Bell Labs. And to create some basic guidance teams and
  organizations might adopt to follow in these organizationsâ€™ footsteps.</p>


<h2>Emacs Notes</h2>

<p>
  I love using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>,
  customizing it, and learning about it. In fact, I
  think that Emacs is my primary hobby at this point. There are a lot of
  wonderful websites and blogs out there dedicated to Emacs. This section
  of my website is my small contribution to the community. I've tried to
  make it so each note describes a useful sample of code that you can
  incorporate into your own configuration.
</p>

<p>
  I hope you find something useful,
  and if you find an error the best way to let me know is to open
  <a href="https://github.com/olivertaylor/olivertaylor.github.io/issues">a GitHub issue</a> about it.

<h2>Code Adventures</h2>

<p>
  My adventures with coding began long ago
  when I wondered if <small>CSS</small> could be used to layout a screenplay,
  the result was <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/screenbundle/">the Screenbundle</a>
  for <a href="https://macromates.com">Textmate</a>
  which allowed you to write screenplays
  in a <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/">Markdown</a>-inspired way
  (this was before the <a href="https://fountain.io">fountain markup syntax</a>
  and a very long time before <a href="https://quoteunquoteapps.com/highland-2/">Highland</a>).
  After a while the project morphed into a <small>UNIX</small>-style <small>CLI</small> program I called...
</p>

<p><b><a href="https://git.io/textplay">Textplay</a></b> is command-line utility
  that converts screenplays written in <a href="https://fountain.io">Fountain</a>
  formatted plain-text to <small>HTML</small> and <small>FDX</small>
  (<a href="http://kb.finaldraft.com/article/1001/325/">Final Draft</a>).
  The <small>HTML</small> can then be easily converted to a pagination-aware <small>PDF</small> with
  <a href="https://princexml.com">PrinceXML</a>.</p>

<p>I've got my <b><a href="https://github.com/olivertaylor/dotfiles">dotfiles</a></b>
  on GitHub, if you're interested in that kind of thing.
  I've learned a lot reading other people's, so I hope you find something you can use yourself.</p>
