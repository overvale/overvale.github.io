<h1>Kill Buffer DWIM</h1>

<time>2021, Summer</time>

<p>When you call <code>kill-buffer</code> Emacs prompts you for which buffer you’d like to kill. The default choice is the current buffer, which is good because 9 times out of 10 that’s the buffer I want to kill, but confirming that choice every time is tedious.</p>
<p>Emacs has a wonderful convention of “do what I mean” (DWIM) commands, versions of commands which do one thing if a condition is met and another if it isn’t. My version of <code>kill-buffer</code> should kill the current buffer by default, and if it is prefixed by the universal argument I should be prompted for which buffer I’d like to kill. The best of both worlds I think.</p>
<pre class="elisp"><code>(defun kill-buffer-dwim (&amp;optional u-arg)
  &quot;Call kill-current-buffer, with C-u: call kill-buffer.&quot;
  (interactive &quot;P&quot;)
  (if u-arg
      (call-interactively &#39;kill-buffer)
    (call-interactively &#39;kill-current-buffer)))</code></pre>
