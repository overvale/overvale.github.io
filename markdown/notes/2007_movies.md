Roger Ebert said:

> It was a time of wonders, an autumn of miracles, one of the best years in recent movie history. One great film after another opened, and movie lovers found there were two or three, sometimes more, must-see films opening on a weekend.

One year later Iron Man, The Dark Knight, and Twilight were released and things… have not been quite the same since.
