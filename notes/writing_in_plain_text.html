<h1>Writing in Plain Text</h1>

<p>Almost every website, piece of software, or communication protocol ever programed was written (at least in part) in plain-text. This makes it the most compatible, reliable, and flexible file-format in existence; one who writes in plain-text can rest assured their files will be readable forever by any computer ever made in their lifetime.</p>

<p>Because programmers work almost exclusively in plain-text they have built themselves amazing tools. With a little work one can learn how to leverage these powerful tools and customize their writing environment as they see fit.</p>

<p>For those who want a universal and future-proof way to store their writing, and powerful and reliable software to write in, plain-text is the ticket.</p>

<ul>
<li>Write in plain-text</li>
<li>Learn to use regular expressions</li>
<li>Use version control</li>
<li>Learn to code a little so you can make tools for yourself</li>
</ul>

<p>Adopting these ways of working introduced me to the idea of putting each clause or idea of a sentence on a separate line. I got the idea from <a href="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/">Brandon Rhodes (by way of Brian W. Kernighan)</a> and have been using it ever since. Here's how he explains it:</p>

<blockquote><p>By starting a new line at the end of each sentence, and splitting sentences themselves at natural breaks between clauses, a text file becomes far easier to edit and version control. Text editors are very good at manipulating lines &mdash; so when each sentence is a contiguous block of lines, your editor suddenly becomes a very powerful mechanism for quickly rearranging clauses and ideas.</p></blockquote>

<p>Splitting each clause of a sentence into separate lines more clearly highlights the structure of a sentence. Apparently, Buckminster Fuller called it "<a href="https://vanemden.wordpress.com/2009/01/01/ventilated-prose/">Ventilated Prose</a>". The effect has been so profound that I now write by hand in this way. (There's even an <a href="https://www.xkcd.com/1285/">xkcd comic</a> about it.)</p>
