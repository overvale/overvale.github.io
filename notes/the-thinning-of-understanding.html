<h1>The Thinning of Understanding</h1>

<p class="date">2026-01-23</p>

<p>In one of my favorite essays, <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/history-is-in-the-making/">History is in the Making</a>, Stephen Davies argues that understanding history through the lens of politics places emphasis on the wrong events, judges their relative importance incorrectly, and ultimately misunderstands which events had the most transformative effects on human life. Additionally, “it implies that if you want to address social problems or challenges, then politics (whether electoral or revolutionary) is the only way to do it. It implies that the news and events we should pay attention to are political ones, because those are what will have the greatest impact.”</p>
<p>Watching or reading today’s news piece about the latest events in one of the world’s oil-soaked lands, or one of the many horrors taking place among us, <em>feels</em> informative and worthwhile, yet more often than not your understanding of the world will not be transformed by it. If, however, you were to put in the substantial effort required to read something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prize:_The_Epic_Quest_for_Oil,_Money,_and_Power"><em>The Prize</em> by Daniel Yergin</a> (a 928 page book) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide:_A_Year_on_the_Killing_Streets"><em>Homicide</em> by David Simon</a> (672 pages), or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Years_of_Lyndon_Johnson"><em>The Years of Lyndon Johnson</em> by Robert Caro</a> (I don’t even know how many pages), you will most likely come away transformed into someone who can see patterns in the world that were previously invisible.</p>
<p>JA Westenberg, in the essay <a href="https://www.joanwestenberg.com/thin-desires-are-eating-your-life/">Thin Desires are Eating Your Life</a>, writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A thick desire is one that changes you in the process of pursuing it. A thin desire is one that doesn’t. […] the person who spends a year learning calculus becomes someone different, someone who can see patterns in the world that were previously invisible, who has expanded the range of things they’re capable of caring about, who has Been Through It. The person who checks their notifications is, afterward, exactly the same person who wanted to check their notifications five minutes ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aldous Huxley wrote about this a century ago. <a href="https://hackneybooks.co.uk/books/364/686/Pleasures.html">Writing about the pleasures of his time</a>—cinema, radio, and newspapers—he lamented how simplistic they had become:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The horrors of modern ‘pleasure’ arise from the fact that every kind of organized distraction tends to become progressively more and more imbecile. […] In place of the old pleasures demanding intelligence and personal initiative, we have vast organizations that provide us with ready-made distractions—distractions which demand from pleasure-seekers no personal participation and no intellectual effort of any sort.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This does not happen because of a dark conspiracy, it happens because of economics. Satisfying thick desires is time-consuming, difficult, does not scale well, and has small profit margins. Thin desires, on the other hand, are more eagerly consumed, cheaper to produce, easier to duplicate and distribute, and have very good margins.</p>
<p>And so, as Westenberg says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The workshops closed, the congregations thinned, the apprenticeships disappeared, the front porches gave way to backyard decks and studio apartments and the coveted Micro Homes where you could be alone with your devices. Meanwhile the infrastructure for thin desires became essentially inescapable. It’s in your pocket right now.</p>
