<h1>Splitting Windows With the Mouse</h1>

<time>2021, Spring</time>

<p>
Did you know you can create and delete window splits with the mouse?
Also, the mode-line has its own... keymap?
</p>

<pre><code>(global-set-key [mode-line S-mouse-1] 'mouse-delete-other-windows)
(global-set-key [mode-line M-mouse-1] 'mouse-delete-window)
(global-set-key [mode-line C-mouse-1] 'mouse-split-window-horizontally)</code></pre>
