<h1>Emacs!</h1>

<p>
  I love using Emacs, customizing it, and learning about it. In fact, I think
  that Emacs is my primary hobby at this point. There are a lot of wonderful
  websites and blogs out there dedicated to Emacs. This section of my website
  is my small contribution to the community.
</p>

<p>
  I've tried to design this to be something of a cookbook, in that each note
  describes a useful sample of code that you can incorporate into your own
  configuration.
</p>

<p>
  I hope you find something useful, and if you find an error here the best way
  to let me know is to open <a href="https://github.com/olivertaylor/olivertaylor.github.io/issues">a GitHub issue</a> about it.</p>
