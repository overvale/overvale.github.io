<h1>Engineering</h1>

<p>An excerpt from <a href="https://medium.com/@yonatanzunger/so-about-this-googlers-manifesto-1e3773ed1788">So, about this Googler’s manifesto.</a>, by Yonatan Zunger.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People who haven't done engineering, or people who have done just the
basics, sometimes think that what engineering looks like is sitting at your
computer and hyper-optimizing an inner loop, or cleaning up a class API. We've
all done this kind of thing, and for many of us (including me) it's tremendous
fun. And when you're at the novice stages of engineering, this is the large
bulk of your work: something straightforward and bounded which can be done
right or wrong, and where you can hone your basic skills.</p>

<p>But it's not a coincidence that job titles at Google switch from numbers to
words at a certain point. That's precisely the point at which you have, in a
way, completed your first apprenticeship: you can operate independently
without close supervision. And this is the point where you start doing real
engineering.</p>

<p>Engineering is not the art of building devices; it's the art of fixing
problems. Devices are a means, not an end. Fixing problems means first of all
understanding them  &mdash;  and since the whole purpose of the things we do is to
fix problems in the outside world, problems involving people, that means that
understanding people, and the ways in which they will interact with your
system, is fundamental to every step of building a system. (This is so key
that we have a bunch of entire job ladders  &mdash;  PM's and UX'ers and so
on  &mdash;  who have done nothing but specialize in those problems. But the
presence of specialists doesn't mean engineers are off the hook; far from it.
Engineering leaders absolutely need to understand product deeply; it's a core
job requirement.)</p>

<p>And once you've understood the system, and worked out what has to be built,
do you retreat to a cave and start writing code? If you're a hobbyist, yes. If
you're a professional, especially one working on systems that can use terms
like "planet-scale" and "carrier-class" without the slightest exaggeration,
then you'll quickly find that the large bulk of your job is about coordinating
and cooperating with other groups. It's about making sure you're all building
one system, instead of twenty different ones; about making sure that
dependencies and risks are managed, about designing the right modularity
boundaries that make it easy to continue to innovate in the future, about
preemptively managing the sorts of dangers that teams like SRE, Security,
Privacy, and Abuse are the experts in catching before they turn your project
into rubble.</p>

<p>Essentially, engineering is all about cooperation, collaboration, and
empathy for both your colleagues and your customers. If someone told you that
engineering was a field where you could get away with not dealing with people
or feelings, then I'm very sorry to tell you that you have been lied to.
Solitary work is something that only happens at the most junior levels, and
even then it's only possible because someone senior to you  &mdash;  most likely your
manager  &mdash;  has been putting in long hours to build up the social structures in
your group that let you focus on code.</p>
