<h1>Not Found!</h1>

<p>
  The thing you're looking for is no longer here (or never was).
  Don't feel bad, it's probably my fault, I hand-code this website
  and everything changes frequently. I don't really have a good way
  to redirect old links.

<p>
  The good news is that this site is small,
  so you can probably find what you're looking for by poking around,
  or with <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en">a google search</a>.
