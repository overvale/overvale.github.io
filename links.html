<p><cite><a href="https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/we-live-like-royalty-and-dont-know-it">We Live Like Royalty and Don‚Äôt Know It</a></cite> is the introduction to a great new series of essays called <a href="https://www.thenewatlantis.com/collections/how-the-system-works">How the System Works</a> by Charles C. Mann.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The great European cathedrals were built over generations by thousands of people and sustained entire communities. Similarly, the electric grid, the public-water supply, the food-distribution network, and the public-health system took the collective labor of thousands of people over many decades. They are the cathedrals of our secular era. They are high among the great accomplishments of our civilization. But they don‚Äôt inspire bestselling novels or blockbuster films. No poets celebrate the sewage treatment plants that prevent them from dying of dysentery. Like almost everyone else, they rarely note the existence of the systems around them, let alone understand how they work.</p>

<p>The Economist has a pretty good write-up on <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/02/13/the-danger-of-relying-on-openais-deep-research">the danger of relying on OpenAI‚Äôs Deep Research</a>, which basically matches my experience. It misses, however, how tools like this can help you overcome little barriers in life.</p>

<p>For example, this morning I used it for 2 things and it saved me tons of time:</p>

<ol>
<li>I wanted to find a company that comes and picks up stuff you want to get rid of and either recycles, donates, or sells it. And wanted to avoid a place that scoops up valuables and takes the rest to the dump. In about 10 minutes it found <a href="http://remoovit.com">remoovit.com</a>, which is pretty much exactly what I want.</li>
<li>I was not directly threatened by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eaton_Fire">Eaton fire</a> but we are nearby and left because the air was filled with ash and because ü§∑! But we soon realized we didn‚Äôt leave the house with everything we should have. We took passports but forgot birth certificates, etc. So I asked Deep Resarch to create a checklist for a ‚Äúgrab and go disaster box‚Äù with all life‚Äôs critical paperwork and valuables. Again, in about 10 minutes I had a really good starting point which I printed out and will start building. Now, would it have been faster to google around and find an existing checklist? Maybe. But this was tailored to my exact needs and requests and I spent those 10 minutes making coffee and talking to my kids instead of googling.</li>
</ol>

<p>These tools make easy the things you‚Äôre currently putting off because there‚Äôs a ‚Äútoil barrier‚Äù you don‚Äôt have the energy or resources to overcome. Those things can seem trivially small but small gains add up over time.</p>

    <p>For most of human civilization, we've had societies where almost everyone was desperately poor and then a few people were marginally less poor. (Poor Americans eat better and have better healthcare than European aristocrats from a few centuries ago. Plus, they don't defecate in buckets they sleep next to, which is a plus.)</p>
    
    <p>The newfangled innovation brought about by capitalism isn't poor people: its rich people. Rich people who are so overflowing with money they buy frivolous shoes, enabling some Chinese peasant to get off the farm. Chinese peasants are pretty much in favor of getting off the farm -- it gives their kids a much better shot at surviving to the age of 5, and means you don't have to deal with famine.</p>

<p>Why is it that talking through a problem is much easier than writing it down? Why is remote, asynchronous, working great for some things but terrible for other things?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.columbia.edu/~rmk7/HC/HC_Readings/Garrod_Pickering.pdf"><cite>Why is conversation so easy?</cite></a> suggests the answer might be that humans are ‚Äúdesigned‚Äù for communication and collaboration ‚Äúbecause it is through dialogue that humans learn to speak in the first place‚Äù.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[‚Ä¶] dialogue supports interactive alignment of linguistic representations. In turn the alignment of representations has the effect of distributing the processing load between the interlocutors [conversation partners] because each reuses information computed by the other.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10234"><cite>The Unbearable Slowness of Being</cite></a> is a paper that explores the large discrepancy between the brain‚Äôs sensory input capacity (around a billion bits per second) and the brain's much slower processing capacity (about 10 bits per second).</p>

<p>This is fascinating to me because it aligns with the ideas in Daniel Kahneman's brilliant book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow"><cite>Thinking, Fast and Slow</cite></a>, which explores the same ideas from a more qualitative perspective.</p>

<p>It also strikes me that this validates much of what Bret Victor (et al.) is exploring with <a href="https://dynamicland.org">Dynamicland</a>. If the brain works as this paper suggests, moving computation from the narrow constraints of a screen designed for serialized processing to an environment that taps into our richer, parallel sensory channels isn‚Äôt just interesting ‚Äî it‚Äôs a fundamentally better paradigm because it aligns with the way our brains are built to process information.</p>

<p><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/history-is-in-the-making/">This essay, called "History is in the making",</a> captures something I've been trying to express to my friends for the last 10 years. Politics matters a lot less than people think, and is not worth the time we spend getting worked up about it.</p>
<blockquote><p>An understanding of the past in which not just our intellectual successes but our technological breakthroughs occupy pride of place would be very different from the political one that dominates now. Instead of politics and war, and the growth, rise, and decline of states and empires being the focus, the central story would rather be one of human cooperation and inventiveness, innovation and scientific and technological progress and discovery, and the improvement in human well-being than the deeds (often diabolical) of those with power.</p>
<p>The important figures would no longer be rulers, generals, prelates, and revolutionaries but scientists, entrepreneurs, and businessmen and -women. It is people like Joe Sutter, Juan Trippe, and Alexander Graham Bell who would be remembered.</p>
<p>If it is the case that human ingenuity solving problems is the most potent force in history, why do so many still fixate upon politics, wars, and revolutions?</p>

The working hours of the day are already, for the great majority of human beings, occupied in the performance of purely mechanical tasks in which no mental effort, no individuality, no initiative are required. And now, in the hours of leisure, we turn to distractions as mechanically stereotyped and demanding as little intelligence and initiative as does our work. Add such leisure to such work and the sum is a perfect day which it is a blessed relief to come to the end of.‚Äù ‚Äî <i>Aldous Huxley</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here is a reminder: the surest way forward is usually a plain approach done with close attention to detail. You can refine the normal into the sophisticated by pursuing clarity and consistency. Attentiveness turns the normal artful.</p>
<p>Plain design frequently uses defaults: Helvetica or Times New Roman, default link blue, A4 or letter-sized paper. These choices are loaded. Not only do they carry the original intention of the default materials, they are also saddled with the cultural meanings associated with choosing them. If a designer uses Helvetica, it suggests one of three things: they are ignorant of the clich√©, choose to look past the clich√©, or want to ironically play with the clich√©. None are satisfactory if one wants to create plain design without wading into the issue. This is why we must continually invent new, plain materials. As soon as a popular and plain material becomes burdened with too many associations, we can drop the baggage and move on.</p>

<p>Untitled Sans and Untitled Serif are quotidian typefaces. Untitled Sans is a plain, neogrotesk sans validated by the ideas of Jasper Morrison and Naoto Fukasawa‚Äôs Super Normal project. When Untitled Sans was nearly finished, I applied the same principles to the creation of Untitled Serif, which is drawn from the old-style genre of types: the post-Caslon, pre-Times workhorses offered by almost every metal type foundry of the time. Untitled Sans and Untitled Serif are related neither by skeleton nor a traditional aesthetic connection, but by concept only.</p>

<p><a href="https://tenochtitlan.thomaskole.nl/index.html">A Portrait of Tenochtitlan</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The year is 1518. Mexico-Tenochtitlan, once an unassuming settlement in the middle of Lake Texcoco, now a bustling metropolis. It is the capital of an empire ruling over, and receiving tribute from, more than 5 million people. Tenochtitlan is home to 200.000 farmers, artisans, merchants, soldiers, priests and aristocrats. At this time, it is one of the largest cities in the world.</p>

<p>Today, we call this city Ciudad de Mexico - Mexico City.</p>

<p>Not much is left of the old Aztec - or Mexica - capital Tenochtitlan. What did this city, raised from the lake bed by hand, look like? Using historical and archeological sources, and the expertise of many, I have tried to faithfully bring this iconic city to life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a friend that was denied a raise after working at a company diligently for five years - there was no budget, he was told. He was upset, and ended up spending a year traveling the world on sabbatical.</p>

<p>While he was away, a new position opened up in the same department, for the same job title - it was a permanent role, theoretically exactly the same job he was doing in an identical team with the same managers. They gave me that job, all the money he asked for, plus another hefty sum on top of it.</p>

<p>Management saying there was no budget meant nothing - it is purely a thing they are forced to say, and if the person saying it was not particularly insightful, they even believed it. The only thing an organization can do that means anything is actually solving your problem, and any words to the effect of "we'll address your concerns soon" or "we just need to do some planning around this", etc, should just be ignored wholesale.</p>

<p>The Nobel laureate particle physicist Frank Wilczek once said that beauty exists as a dance between opposite forces. First, he said, beauty benefits from symmetry, which he defined as ‚Äúchange without change.‚Äù If you rotate a circle, it remains a circle, just as reversing the sides of an equation still reveals a truth (2+2=4, and 4=2+2). But beauty also draws from what Wilczek calls ‚Äúexuberance,‚Äù or emergent complexity. Looking up at the interior of a mosque or a cathedral, or gazing at a classic Picasso or Pollock painting, you are seeing neither utter chaos nor a simple symmetry, but rather a kind of synthesis; an artistic dizziness bounded within a sense of order, which gives the whole work an appealing comprehensibility.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-creative-process-is-fabulously-unpredictable-a-great-idea-cannot-be-predicted#/">McKinsey's Quarterly Interview with Jony Ive</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Founders are creatives by definition ‚Äî they had the idea behind a company.</p>

<p>To make that idea material and relevant, they need to work with a collection of people. But the nature of ideas and the creative process is so particular and unusual. It‚Äôs an activity that doesn‚Äôt naturally or easily sit within a large group of people.</p>

<p>When you gather a large group of people, they generally want to be able to relate to one another and to be sociable. But any process that is unpredictable does not sit comfortably or naturally in a large group setting. So people come to value activities that are predictable.</p>

<p>This doesn‚Äôt mean that you would willfully want to undermine those activities that are predictable. But that is the nature of creating. And one of the things I realized is that when you‚Äôre trying to create in the context of a large group of people with a whole range of different expertise, people tend to want to gravitate to those attributes or characteristics of a product that you can measure easily. If you‚Äôre trying to relate to a group of very different people and you want to appear sociable and engaged and connected, it‚Äôs much easier to talk about something that you can measure with a number. That‚Äôs why we choose to talk about schedule or cost or speed or weight. Given our very different backgrounds, that‚Äôs a comfortable and easy conversation. I completely get it.</p>

<p>But there‚Äôs an insidious problem with that. There is a dangerous assumption that we‚Äôre having these conversations because they‚Äôre the only important ones. But the really important conversations and preoccupations and concerns are very hard. Because you can‚Äôt assign a system of numbers to make the relative judgments that need to be made.</p>

<p>I used to think that this kind of conversation was a personal attack, or an affront to the practice of creating, but I‚Äôve come to learn, over the years, that it‚Äôs just a natural, very predictable consequence of having larger numbers of people gather together to talk about developing something.</p>

The very banality of the toy, the artlessness of the sculpting and the way the paint doesn‚Äôt even quite line up with the contours of the doll‚Äôs face, prove that this is not the toy of a prince ‚Äî but of poor child. And they would understand that the people of our time are so wealthy, so powerful, that every one of them has access to machines with thousands of parts working in concert, and that it is less effort to build such a wondrous machine than to simply paint a doll‚Äôs eyebrows in their right places.</p>

<blockquote><p>How can you possibly justify a $200,000+ college expense? How can you justify a $100,000+ college expense? <p>This is not necessary.
<p>The average tenure hopeful adjunct makes $40 an hour. If you were to employ her as a private tutor at the cost of $60 an hour, and had four hours with her a week, and did that for 14 weeks (that‚Äôs the length of an average college course folks) that is about $3,400.
<p>Were you to employ three such professor-tutors, that would be about $10,200, or a bit over $20,000 a year. In four years you would have racked up $80,000 in costs. But this is still $30,000 less than the total for the ‚Äòcost conscious‚Äô universities. It is a quarter of what you would pay for Trinity.
<p>Remember: this $80,000 is for private tutoring, where individual attention would give you far and away a better and more thorough education than the 300-kids-in-a-lecture-hall style of classes that dominate undergraduate education today. <p>But it can get even cheaper. Let‚Äôs say you take the general principle of group classes from the university. Say you can find four other people to take all of these other classes with you. Just four. Well that equals out to $680 per class, or $16,000 a person for four years of classes.
<p>To be fair, add in $1,000-$2,000 for textbooks and a subscription to JSTOR, for a total of about $17,000 to $18,000 for four years.</p></blockquote>
