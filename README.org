#+TITLE: olivertaylor.net Readme

This directory contains all the source code for building [[https://olivertaylor.net][olivertaylor.net]], and
all its content.

This site is managed by a very basic static-site generator, written in elisp.
This code, and all the source for the pages themselves, is in the ~lib~
directory. Therefore, don't edit any of the pages in the root directory, use
the static-site generator instead.
