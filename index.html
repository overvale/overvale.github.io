<h1>Hello!</h1>

<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
  Hi! ðŸ‘‹
  <b>I'm Oliver Taylor</b>, welcome to my corner of the internet.
  This website is a random collection of things I've worked on
  and some write-ups about things I find interesting.
  I have no idea how you got here but I'm glad you made it.
</p>

<h2>Structured to Innovate</h2>

<p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Lockheed
  Martinâ€™s Skunk Works, and AT&amp;Tâ€™s Bell Labs were a few of many
  R&amp;D organizations that, in the mid 20th century, created technology
  that helped usher-in the modern world (computers, the internet,
  communication satellites, digital cameras, etc.). The methods these
  organizations used in running their organizations also became famous.
  Despite being very different from each other, they share a similar ethos
  and approach to project management that teams and organizations of any
  size (and funding level) can learn from.</p>

<h2>Emacs Notes</h2>

<p>
  I love using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>,
  customizing it, and learning about it. In fact, I
  think that Emacs is my primary hobby at this point. There are a lot of
  wonderful websites and blogs out there dedicated to Emacs. This section
  of my website is my small contribution to the community. I've tried to
  make it so each note describes a useful sample of code that you can
  incorporate into your own configuration.
</p>

<p>
  I hope you find something useful,
  and if you find an error the best way to let me know is to open
  <a href="https://github.com/olivertaylor/olivertaylor.github.io/issues">a GitHub issue</a> about it.

<h2>Code Adventures</h2>

<p>
  My adventures with coding began long ago
  when I wondered if CSS could be used to layout a screenplay,
  the result was <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/screenbundle/">the Screenbundle</a>
  for <a href="https://macromates.com">Textmate</a>
  which allowed you to write screenplays
  in a <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/">Markdown</a>-inspired way
  (this was before the <a href="https://fountain.io">fountain markup syntax</a>
  and a very long time before <a href="https://quoteunquoteapps.com/highland-2/">Highland</a>).
  After a while the project morphed into a UNIX-style CLI program I called...
</p>

<p><b><a href="https://git.io/textplay">Textplay</a></b> is command-line utility
  that converts screenplays written in <a href="https://fountain.io">Fountain</a>
  formatted plain-text to HTML and FDX
  (<a href="http://kb.finaldraft.com/article/1001/325/">Final Draft</a>).
  The HTML can then be easily converted to a pagination-aware PDF with
  <a href="https://princexml.com">PrinceXML</a>.</p>

<p>I've got my <b><a href="https://github.com/olivertaylor/dotfiles">dotfiles</a></b>
  on GitHub, if you're interested in that kind of thing.
  I've learned a lot reading other people's, so I hope you find something you can use yourself.</p>
