<h1>Recommended Books</h1>

<p>Books are one of humanity’s greatest creations. Perhaps <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nkpkg_sL8">Carl Sagan said it best</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What an astonishing thing a book is. One glance at it and you’re inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you.</p>
<p>Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs, books break the shackles of time. A book is a proof that humans are capable of working magic.</p>
