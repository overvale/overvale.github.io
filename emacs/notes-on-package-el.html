<h1>How Package.el Works with Use Package</h1>

<time>2021-04-31</time>

<p>
  <i>I suppose the below could be framed simply as a complaint that
    use-package does not update <code>package-selected-packages</code>. Fair
    enough.</i>
</p>

<p>
I've recently moved from Straight to package.el for package management (long
story), and have been reading-up on how package.el actually works, I took some
notes and figured I'd share. I'm surprised that so few configs I see on GitHub
take into account the subtleties of how package.el works, particularly in how
it interacts with Use Package.
</p>

<p>
  Unsurprisingly, all of this is well documented in
  <code>(info "(elisp) Startup Summary")</code> and
  <code>(info "(emacs) Packages")</code> so I'm not writing anything
  groundbreaking here, just summarizing available information.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
  Emacs "activates" <i>all installed packages</i> <b>before</b> reading the
  user-init-file unless you've set <code>package-enable-at-startup</code> to nil
  in the early init file. I'm sure this activation does many things but the most
  important (to me) is that it creates autoloads for all your packages. That way
  you can bind a key to a package's command, or run it via <code>M-x</code>,
  without actually loading the package first.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to restrict exactly which installed packages are activated at
  startup you can customize the <code>package-load-list</code>, but you have to do it
  before your packages are activated.
</p>

<p>
  When you interactively install a package (via <code>M-x package-install</code>
  or via the Package Menu) Emacs adds that package to
  <code>package-selected-packages</code> in your custom-file, which is
  supposed to be the canonical list of packages you'd like installed.
  package.el includes commands for installing all your "selected" packages,
  and removing any installed package that is not "selected".
</p>

<p>
  Use Package does not update <code>package-selected-packages</code>, nor does
  it have the ability to delete installed packages. This means every package
  you've ever installed via Use Package's <code>:ensure</code> function is
  activated when Emacs starts up, even if you've removed all traces of it from
  your init file. And to remove the packages from your system you'll have to
  manually compare what's installed against what's in your init file.
</p>

<p>
  If you've disabled <code>package-enable-at-startup</code> in your early init
  file and use <a href"https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el">Straight</a>
  (or something similar) to install packages, you won't have this
  problem as Straight is designed to never load anything not declared in your
  init file, regardless of if it is installed or not.
</p>

<p>
What I learned&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
If you're using an alternative to package.el such as Straight, don't forget to
place <code>(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)</code> in your early init file.
</p>

<p>
  If you're using Use Package with package.el, and you want to manage your
  packages via your init file and <b>not</b> via interactive customization,
  you should really consider manually maintaining <code>package-selected-packages</code>
  somewhere in your init file, and abstaining from Use Package's <code>:ensure</code>
  feature. Think of Use Package strictly as a way to configure packages, not
  installing them. This will allow you to take advantage of package.el's package
  management features.
</p>

<p>
  The following is everything you need to get your packages installed and
  configured using package.el + Use Package:
</p>

<pre><code>(require 'package)

;; (package-initialize) is unnecessary since I have not disabled
;; package-enable-at-startup in early-init.

;; Add MELPA to package sources (optional)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)

;; Prefer GNU over MELPA (optional)
(setq package-archive-priorities '(("gnu" . 20)("melpa" . 10)))

(setq package-selected-packages
  '(use-package
    vertico
    orderless))

;; Install packages with (package-install-selected-packages)
;; Remove packages with (package-autoremove)
;; If you want to automate that, maybe add them to your 'emacs-startup-hook'?

(eval-when-compile
  (require 'use-package))

(use-package orderless
  :demand
  :custom
  (completion-styles '(orderless))
  (completion-category-defaults nil)
  (completion-category-overrides '((file (styles . (partial-completion))))))

(use-package vertico
  :init (vertico-mode))</code></pre>

<p>
To install a new package, simply add it your package-selected-packages list
and call <code>(package-install-selected-packages)</code>.
</p>

<p>
Hope this is useful to someone.
