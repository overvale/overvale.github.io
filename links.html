<li><p>“[...] the economists would be amazed. For this design — so far beyond the peak of their world’s powers — was not a gift for a King or Queen, but clearly just <a href="http://www.tobyord.com/writing/a-childs-plaything">a child’s toy</a>. And not just that. The very banality of the toy, the artlessness of the sculpting and the way the paint doesn’t even quite line up with the contours of the doll’s face, prove that this is not the toy of a prince — but of poor child. And they would understand that the people of our time are so wealthy, so powerful, that every one of them has access to machines with thousands of parts working in concert, and that it is less effort to build such a wondrous machine than to simply paint a doll’s eyebrows in their right places.”</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.alexmurrell.co.uk/articles/the-age-of-average">The Age of Average</a> argues that from film to fashion and architecture to advertising, creative fields have become dominated and defined by convention and cliché.

<li><p>“I feel that starting from when? I don’t know, from the ’50s or the ’60s or ’70s — at a certain point, the experience of culture — whether it’s painting or something else — the nature of the experience shifted to something that had more in common with journalism than with what we might call “an aesthetic experience,” that works of art were thought to be about something. What that “about” was, or is, is something that could be more or less easily grasped. It’s the <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/david-salle/">aboutness</a> which, for me, is a short-circuiting of the art experience.”</p></li>

<li><p>“People don’t realize that every single advanced manufacturing company — whether they’re making rockets, satellites, jets, drones, or energy for climate change — outsources about 80% to 90% of their custom parts. This isn’t like automotive where you’re printing 1,000 widgets to go on a Ford. This is ‘Hey, we need five crazy complex-geometry parts that are going on a rocket.‘ It’s about $40 or $50 billion in spend that’s coming out of these space, defense, and other advanced manufacturers going into a domestic supply chain, but it’s being routed through 3,000 or so <a href="https://future.com/why-the-time-is-right-to-disrupt-defense-and-aerospace/">small, owner-operated high-precision machine shops</a>. So, in aggregate, it’s a huge industry, but it’s incredibly fragmented. You’ve really got 98% of that base doing less than $10 million in revenue.”</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/05/the-economics-of-college-vs-the-economics-of-private-tutors.html">The economics of college vs. the economics of private tutors</a></p> 
<blockquote><p>“How can you possibly justify a $200,000+ college expense? How can you justify a $100,000+ college expense? <p>This is not necessary.
<p>The average tenure hopeful adjunct makes $40 an hour. If you were to employ her as a private tutor at the cost of $60 an hour, and had four hours with her a week, and did that for 14 weeks (that’s the length of an average college course folks) that is about $3,400. 
<p>Were you to employ three such professor-tutors, that would be about $10,200, or a bit over $20,000 a year. In four years you would have racked up $80,000 in costs. But this is still $30,000 less than the total for the ‘cost conscious’ universities. It is a quarter of what you would pay for Trinity.
<p>Remember: this $80,000 is for private tutoring, where individual attention would give you far and away a better and more thorough education than the 300-kids-in-a-lecture-hall style of classes that dominate undergraduate education today. <p>But it can get even cheaper. Let’s say you take the general principle of group classes from the university. Say you can find four other people to take all of these other classes with you. Just four. Well that equals out to $680 per class, or $16,000 a person for four years of classes. 
<p>To be fair, add in $1,000-$2,000 for textbooks and a subscription to JSTOR, for a total of about $17,000 to $18,000 for four years.”</p></blockquote></li>

Then one night you ask the lyre player to play for you and they say: ‘My lyre is all scratched up and I did ask for a lyre technician but you said not yet and if I had one I could come and play for you now.’ So you’ve got to have a lyre technician and then you better get him an Uber account too.”</p></li>

Senior people do not. ‘When you’re the janitor,’ Jobs has repeatedly told incoming VPs, ‘reasons matter.’ He continues: ‘Somewhere between the janitor and the CEO, reasons stop mattering.’ That Rubicon, he has said, ’is crossed when you become a VP.’”</p></li>

<li><p>“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/21/how-to-write-a-great-sentence">A good sentence</a> imposes a logic on the world’s weirdness. It gets its power from the tension between the ease of its phrasing and the shock of its thought slid cleanly into the mind. A sentence, as it proceeds, is a paring away of options. Each added word, because of the English language’s dependence on word order, reduces the writer’s alternatives and narrows the reader’s expectations. But even up to the last word the writer has choices and can throw in a curveball.”</p></li>

<li><p>“I’ve written six books now, but instead of making it easier, it has <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/everything-is-fiction">complicated matters to the point of absurdity</a>. I have no idea what I’m doing. All the decisions I appear to have made—about plots and characters and where to start and when to stop—are not decisions at all. They are compromises. A book is whittled down from hope, and when I start to cut my fingers I push it away from me to see what others make of it. And I wait in terror for the judgements of those others—judgements that seem, whether positive or negative, unjust, because they are about something that I didn’t really do. They are about something that happened to me. It’s a little like crawling from a car crash to be greeted by a panel of strangers holding up score cards.</p></li>
