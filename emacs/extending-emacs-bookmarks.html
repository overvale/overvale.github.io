<h1>Extending Emacs Bookmarks to Work With EWW</h1>

<time>2021-02-07</time>

<p>
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Bookmarks.html">Emacs bookmarks</a> are pretty wonderful, you can bookmark almost anything: files,
directories, info and help buffers, <a href="https://magit.vc">Magit</a> buffers, <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed#bookmarks">elfeed</a> searches and
entries. And, naturally, you can extend Emacs to be able to bookmark almost
anything you want.
</p>

<p>
There's a basic web browser in Emacs called <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eww.html">EWW</a> which, by default, uses its
own bookmarking system rather than Emacs's global one. This note demonstrates
how to extend Emacs to make EWW use the standard bookmarks system.
</p>

<p><i>As of September 2021 <a href="http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/etc/NEWS?id=da89bdde2e3aa941594a112db884ede1beaac658">Emacs added support</a> for exactly this feature.
But the below is still a useful way to learn how the bookmarking system creates and uses bookmarks.</i></p>

<hr />

<p>
Let's start by taking a closer look at what a bookmark looks like under the
hood. When you type <code>M-x bookmark-set</code> Emacs adds a 'record' to the
<code>bookmark-alist</code>. This list is then saved to a file (defined in the variable
<code>bookmark-default-file</code>) so you don't loose your bookmarks when you quit Emacs.
An individual bookmark record looks like this:
</p>

<pre><code>(front-context-string . "13.8 Bookmarks\n=")
(rear-context-string . " Up: Registers\n\n")
(position . 251555)
(filename . "/Users/oht/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/info/emacs")
(info-node . "Bookmarks")
(handler . Info-bookmark-jump))</code></pre>

<p>
Let's break that down piece-by-piece.
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>(emacs) Bookmarks</code> is the name of the bookmark, and what gets displayed in
the bookmark list.</li>
<li><code>front-context-string</code> and <code>rear-context-string</code> help keep your bookmarks
accurate when you edit a file after setting a bookmark. If you simply
recorded the filename and line number subsequent edits to the file would
quickly render your bookmarks inaccurate. Emacs uses the position and
context to keep the bookmark accurate.</li>
<li><code>position</code> is the point's position in the buffer.</li>
<li><code>filename</code> is pretty self explanatory, as is <code>info-node</code> (which is specific to
bookmarking the info manuals).</li>
<li><code>handler</code> defines the function that <code>bookmark-jump</code> will use to go to that
bookmark.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Detailed information about how bookmark records can be found by describing the
variable <code>bookmark-alist</code>.
</p>

<p>
With a little imagination, one can envision a bookmark record for a webpage
that looks something like this:
</p>

<pre><code>("Name of Webpage"
(location . "https://example.com")
(handler . eww-handler-function))</code></pre>

<p>
Emacs refers to a function which creates these records as a "bookmark make
record function". In this case that function would look like this:
</p>

<pre><code>(defun custom-make-record-function ()
 `(,(name-bookmark-function)
   (location . ,(get-url-function))
   (handler . eww-handler-function)))</code></pre>

<p>
Emacs uses different functions to create each kind of bookmark; one function
for bookmarking files and another for bookmarking directories. Defining which
function to use in which context is the job of the variable
<code>bookmark-make-record-function</code>. In our case we want to set that variable, when
using EWW, to the name of our custom make record function. Then, when you type
<code>M-x bookmark-set</code> Emacs will call your make-record function and insert the
record into the <code>bookmark-alist</code>.
</p>

<p>
Now that we understand how it works, we can enumerate all the pieces we'll
need.
</p>

<ol>
<li>We need to write a function which creates a properly formatted bookmark
record.</li>
<li>We need a way to open the URL from the bookmark list, a 'handler' function.</li>
<li>We need to set the variable <code>bookmark-make-record-function</code> locally when EWW
buffers are created.</li>
</ol>

<p>
First, the make-record function. You can grab the url from EWW with the
function <code>eww-current-url</code> but EWW provides no such function for getting the
page's title. You can, however, grab the page title with a little lisp:
<code>(plist-get eww-data :title)</code>. All together the complete make-record function
looks like this:
</p>

<pre><code>(defun oht-eww-bookmark-make-record ()
 "Make a bookmark record for the current eww buffer."
 `(,(plist-get eww-data :title)
   ((location . ,(eww-current-url))
    (handler . oht-eww-bookmark-handler)
    (defaults . (,(plist-get eww-data :title))))))</code></pre>

<p>
(It's not clear <i>to me</i> why the <code>defaults</code> part of this is needed but without it
EWW will not properly update the <code>:title</code> when browsing pages. This fix was
<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-humanities/2021-02/msg00014.html">suggested by Joe Corneli</a>.)
</p>

<p>
Second, the handler function for jumping to the URL:
</p>

<pre><code>(defun oht-eww-bookmark-handler (record)
 "Jump to a bookmark's url with bookmarked location."
 (eww (bookmark-prop-get record 'location)))</code></pre>

<p>
Third, we need to set the buffer-local variable <code>bookmark-make-record-function</code>
to the name of our custom make-record function when using EWW. We do this by
first defining a function which sets the local variable, then adding a hook to
<code>eww-mode</code> which calls that function. Like this:
</p>

<pre><code>(defun oht-eww-set-bookmark-handler ()
 "Assigns `bookmark-make-record-function' to a custom function."
 (set (make-local-variable 'bookmark-make-record-function)
      #'oht-eww-bookmark-make-record))

(add-hook 'eww-mode-hook 'oht-eww-set-bookmark-handler)</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>
Now, when visiting a page in EWW you can type <code>M-x bookmark-set</code> and a bookmark will
be created, and jumping to that bookmark will open the URL in EWW.
</p>

<p>
While this example is specific to the EWW browser, it should give you an idea
of how you can extend Emacs's bookmarking system in other ways.
