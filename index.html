        <p>Welcome to my website. I'm a former Visual Effects professional who is trying to figure out what comes next. Here I write about things that interest me and publish some of my more formalized writing.</p>

                    Innovate</a></dt>
            <dd>An attempt to summarize the common ethos and project management approach of The Defense Advanced
                Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works, and AT&amp;T’s Bell Labs. And to create
                some basic guidance teams and organizations might adopt to follow in these organizations’ footsteps.

            <dd>This study attempts to summarize how NASA’s System Engineers operate in order to better understand how
                to manage complex technical projects.</dd>

            <dt><a href="/writing/systems-engineering-vfx.html">Systems Engineering for Visual Effects</a></dt>
            <dd>This paper describes Systems Engineering, as practiced by NASA, and explores the application of its
                principles and techniques to the operation of visual effects (VFX) studios. It discusses challenges in
                VFX projects, like complexity management and technical/artistic integration, and proposes that VFX
                studios could improve their engineering and operations by adopting the perspective and methods of
                Systems Engineering.</dd>

        <p><a href="https://code.claude.com/">Claude Code</a> is as good as everyone says it is. I just started trying it seriously this week and so far I've knocked a few long-standing projects off my list.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Created a "Novel Writing" major mode for Emacs.</li>
        <li>Added 2 sections to one of my essays that I've been thinking about for months.</li>
        <li>Finished an entirely new essay that I spent a whole day failing to make progress on last week.</li>
        <li>I refactored my entire website to markdown and built a script to convert the files to HTML so I can manage the entire thing in markdown. So, basically, created a mini CMS. In one night.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Each of these hook a few hours. I even updated my website with this note just by telling Claude to do so.</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>A thick desire is one that changes you in the process of pursuing it. A thin desire is one that doesn't. […] the person who spends a year learning calculus becomes someone different, someone who can see patterns in the world that were previously invisible, who has expanded the range of things they're capable of caring about, who has Been Through It. The person who checks their notifications is, afterward, exactly the same person who wanted to check their notifications five minutes ago. […] The business model of most consumer technology is to identify some thick desire, find the part of it that produces a neurological reward, and then deliver that reward without the rest of the package.</p>

        <p>I'm an AI optimist, but when reading about how AI will change everything (it will) I can't help but remember this line from <cite><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/t-e-lawrence/seven-pillars-of-wisdom/text/chapter-33#:~:text=The%20printing%20press,from%20the%20body%E2%80%99s%20funds">The Seven Pillars of Wisdom</a></cite> by TE Lawrence:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The printing press, and each newly-discovered method of communication favoured the intellectual above the physical, civilisation paying the mind always from the body’s funds.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>No matter how wonderful our computational advances are we must translate these advances into the physical realm to truly benefit from them. Saying “Cool tech, let me know when it can do my dishes or pick my kid up from school” isn't AI pessimism but the essence of the problem that needs solving. No one needs smarter computers for their own sake, they need better standards of living and new capabilities.</p>

        <p>Andrej Karpathy (OpenAI founding member, Tesla veteran, major contributor to today’s AI frameworks) made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw">really good video</a> going over the practical use of large language models. Dense, clear, highly accessible, but doesn't shy from complexity. Think of it as an excellent two-hour lecture.</p>
